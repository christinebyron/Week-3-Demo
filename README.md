# Week 3 Demo Repository

This week focused on the deployment of a sample Python application ("Hello World") into a Python-based Google App Engine (GAE) project. A successful return will generate “hello world” as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) response.

The steps taken to demonstrate the set up of GCP include:

    1.    Project setup
    2.    Build and Run the "Hello World" App
    
Badge Status will show whether commited code changes were successful: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/christinebyron/Week-3-Demo.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/christinebyron/Week-3-Demo)
